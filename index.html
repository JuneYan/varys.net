          <h1 id="overview">What is Varys?</h1>
          <p>
            Varys is an open source network manager/scheduler that aims to improve communication performance of Big Data applications.
            Its target applications/jobs include those written in Spark, Hadoop, YARN, BSP, and similar data-parallel frameworks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite the differences of end goals and/or programmability among data-parallel frameworks, their communication is structured, takes place between groups of machines in successive computation stages, and often involves a collection of parallel flows.
            More importantly, communication in these applications exhibit the <em>all-or-nothing</em> property&mdash;<em>a communication stage cannot finish until all its flows have completed</em>. 
            The <a href="#coflow">coflow</a> abstraction represents such collections of parallel flows to convey job-specific communication requirements – for example, minimizing completion time or meeting a deadline – to the network and enables application-aware network scheduling.
          </p>
          <p>
            Varys provides a simple API that allows data-parallel frameworks to express their communication requirements as coflows with minimal changes to the framework. 
            Using coflows as the basic abstraction of network scheduling, Varys implements <a href="#scheduler">novel schedulers</a> either to make applications faster or to make time-restricted applications complete within deadlines.

          <h3>How to Use it?</h3>
          <p>
            Enabling Varys in <em>all</em> the applications written in a framework can be as simple as changing the <samp>send</samp> and <samp>recv</samp> calls (or their equivalents) to their analogous <samp>put</samp> and <samp>get</samp> methods in the coflow API, which are exposed through the <samp>VarysClient</samp> class.
          </p>
          <p>
            Existing user-written jobs can take advantage of coflows <em>without</em> any modifications.

          <p>
            A coflow is a collection of flows that share a common performance goal, such as minimizing the completion time of the latest flow or ensuring that flows meet a common deadline. 
            Currently, we assume that the amount of data each flow needs to transfer is known before it starts. 
            The flows of a coflow are <em>independent</em> in that the input of a flow does not depend on the output of another in the same coflow, and the endpoints of these flows can be in one or more machines. 
          </p>

            Effectively, one can consider a coflow to be a <em>data-parallel network job</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Examples of coflows include the shuffle between the mappers and the reducers in MapReduce and the communication stage in the bulk-synchronous parallel (BSP) model.
            In fact, coflows can express most communication patterns between successive computation stages of data-parallel applications. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, traditional point-to-point communication is also a coflow with a single flow.

          <h3 id="scheduler">How/Why Does Coflow Scheduling Work in Varys?</h3>
          <p>
            Varys schedules coflows using heuristics developed to solve the recently discovered <em>concurrent open shop scheduling with coupled resources</em> problem.
            Similar to most scheduling problems, optimal coflow scheduling is computationally intractable. 
          </p>
          <p>
            From 10000 feet, the algorithm proceeds in two steps: Varys keeps an ordered list of coflows, preempting whenever necessary. Next, it uses an algorithm to allocate minimum required bandwidth to each flow of a coflow to complete all of its flows together. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In essence, Varys minimizes interleaving across coflows to minimize coflow completion times (CCT), while sacrificing flow-level fairness or flow completion times (FCT) that are not correlated to a job's completion time.
          </p>
          <h4>Example</h4>
          <p>
            Consider two coflows C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>; C<sub>1</sub> has three flows transferring 1, 2, and 4 units of data, while C<sub>2</sub> has two flows transferring 2 data units each.
          </p>
          <p>
            Per-flow schemes focus on fair sharing or decreasing FCT, without caring about application's completion. Varys does the opposite.

          <p class="question">Is Varys a new protocol? Does it depend on a new one?</p>
          <p class="answer">
            No. 
            Varys runs in the application layer on top of whatever underlying networking protocol your cluster uses. 
            No changes to your hardware or OS is required. 
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            Except for minor changes to the frameworks, user jobs can take advantage of Varys transparently as well.
          </p>

          <p class="question">Will it always improve performance?</p>
          <p class="answer">
            Varys will improve performance most of the time, specially when you have a multi-user, multi-framework cluster. 
            Currently, overheads due to Varys's centralized design sometimes make it less useful for sub-second jobs and cause deadline misses on rare occasions. 
            We are working on both directions: to make it more efficient by design and to better engineer the current system.
          </p>

          <p class="question">Which frameworks support Varys?</p>
          <p class="answer">
            We are currently working on ensuring Varys support in Spark and plan on enabling Hadoop MapReduce 2.0 as well. 
            We will appreciate your help in any of these endeavors.
          </p>

          <p class="question">Which languages does Varys support?</p>
          <p class="answer">
            Currently Varys provides an interface only to JVM-based languages. 
            It can support non-JVM languages as well, but we need your help to implement the language-specific interface to Varys.
